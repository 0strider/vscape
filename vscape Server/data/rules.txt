@dre@=Rules=
1. No serious Doxxing/Harassment. 
Calling each other names is one thing, 
but don't ruin someone's life over 
some pess prices.

2. No Duping. It destabilizes the already
delicate economy. Duping will result in 
account deletion, as well as IP and Mac bans.

3. No Botting. Bots will be investigated and 
banned as seen fit. Banning means anything from
temp 10 hour ban to account deletion.
